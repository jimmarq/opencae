# OpenCAE

The goal of the OpenCAE project is to provide free resources for institutions implementing the Department of Homeland Security & National Security Agency Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) curriculum.

This repository contains documents published on http://opencaecd.org. (Website registration is in process.)

The primary audience of this repository is instructors at colleges and universities who teach CAE-CD knowledge units. The resources are not initially intended to replace existing textbooks or other resources used in courses. Rather, these resources will augment existing textbooks and fill gaps.

# Plan

This project will proceed in multiple phases:

* 2020-2021: Minimum viable content will be create for foundational, core, and selected optional knowledge units.
* 2021-2022: Exercises to support knowledge units.
* 2022 and onward: Minimum viable coverage of all knowledge units. Expanded content in all foundational and core knowledge units. Increased coverage in optional knowledge units.

This sucess of this plan will rely on increased participation.

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome and will likely take one of two forms:

1. Small updates or corrections to existing eBooks. GitHub issues can be opened or pull requests can be created.
2. Creation of new eBooks. Aspiring authors are encourage to take the lead and create content to fill in knowledge unit gaps. Authors should follow standard conventions. The standards are currently pending.
